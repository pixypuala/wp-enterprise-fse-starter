# Next 48 Updates — wp-enterprise-fse-starter

## Why this file exists

This is a sequenced, honest backlog of at least 48 planned updates that keeps the repository genuinely active over time. Each item is a real unit of work (one issue or pull request) that advances capability, testing, security, documentation, or maintenance — not artificial busywork. Items are ordered so that early work unblocks later work, and grouped into six release milestones. Nothing here is claimed as already done: this is the forward plan.

## How to use it

Convert each checkbox into a tracked issue, attach it to the matching milestone, and close it with the pull request that satisfies it. Aim for a steady cadence (for example one to three items per week) so commit history, releases, and changelog entries reflect continuous, verifiable progress. Re-open or add items whenever revalidation, upstream releases, or user reports surface new work.

Total planned updates: **48** across **6** milestones.

## M1 — v0.1 Foundations & scaffolding

- [ ] **#29** Profile and reduce editor bundle size with code-splitting
- [ ] **#30** Add a WordPress/PHP version support matrix and test the lowest supported pair
- [ ] **#31** Document a rollback procedure for a bad theme/plugin release

## Honesty note

These updates are planned, not completed. They do not assert the software is already built, adopted, certified, bug-free, or secure in every environment. They describe the intended, testable path of work and the cadence for keeping the repository maintained.
